Characters drawn by me on magma. However, the gun was drawn by someone else.

1. I can either be talkative or not talkative at all, its random but i think it might depend on my mood, my texts can be dry or can be full of life, if im silent / not talkative, its not because of you, thats just how i am as a person!

2. The fandoms im in are : CRK.. and thats it!

3. I love art! Drawing, writing, any form of art, really! ( I really wanna learn how to sculpt and sow blehh.. one day... )

4. I like saying random words. Ex : Cheese.

5. If I upset you.. clarity is key! I suck at reading cues so pleaaaseeee tell me if you're upset at me, no reason to hide it away. Your feelings matter too!

6. I have a LITTLE bit of trouble starting conversations, but I'm working on it!
